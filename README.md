catch phrase game

Hello. This is Wordsmith, a simply word, definitino matching game.



To start:

	Grab the aporopratie technoligies (listed in package.json and bower.json), run the database (mongod) and server (nodemon).

 	Run the seed.js file (if db is unpopulated).

 	Load index.js to browser and enjoy.

 	**********
Technologies Used:

	Underscore
	Bootstrap
	jQuery
	Express
	Mongo DB
	Mongoose

	**********
Given time what I would have tried to do:

	There was a third template that would render on completeion of the game as a sort of spash page congratulating you on finishing the game and giving the user thier score. Couldn't get the template and functions to work properly.

	I'd add a timer for each question to count down before automatically marking the question as wrong (15-30 seconds).

	More would have been done with CSS and Bootstrap, the sort of minimalist thing I have going looks... a bit cool I suppose, but it wasn't my original idea (timing issue).

	I would expand the database to allow sections of phrases (hard ones, mid level words, and an easy list) to generate a difficulty level to the game. I would also like the list of wrong answers to be in the database as well. (User would be able to contribute to each list respectively).

***Note: Yes, my daughter Eden did get to add a phrase to the database, penance for me having to be plugged through the weekend.
